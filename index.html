                <p>
                  Hi, I'm Corbin Reak — a 22-year-old aspiring software developer from Loveland, Colorado. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Phoenix, with an expected graduation in July 2029.
                  I’m passionate about solving problems and love the creative process of turning ideas into functional applications. My focus areas include building mobile apps, fixing bugs, and developing user-friendly websites.
                  So far, I've created several sample websites, ranging from static pages to fully responsive layouts. I’ve also built a JavaScript-based message generator and continue to deepen my experience with front-end development.
                  As of June 2025, my technical skill set includes:

                 HTML
                 CSS
                 JavaScript
                 Familiarity with jQuery syntax and usage
                 I’m excited to keep growing, building, and eventually contribute to real-world software that makes a difference.
